## üéØ **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

### **Three Intersection Points That Make or Break StreamrP2P:**

1. **Economic Viability of Hybrid Model**
   - The 10% platform fee must cover CDN fallback costs
   - Build comprehensive economic model FIRST before any development
   - Must achieve >30% P2P offload rate for positive unit economics

2. **Infrastructure + Economic Incentives Alignment**  
   - Prevent "lazy relays" that earn tokens but force expensive CDN fallbacks
   - Platform could pay twice: tokens to poor relay + CDN costs for fallbacks
   - Implement "Proof-of-Relay-Quality" system linking rewards to actual performance

3. **Regulatory + Token Utility Integration**
   - Non-financial token utility must come BEFORE any trading/speculation features
   - "Product-First, Token-Later" geographic strategy to build US user base safely
   - Create genuine utility sinks that defend against Howey test classification
