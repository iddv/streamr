# 🎉 StreamrP2P - "Restreaming as Support" Platform

> **🚀 BREAKTHROUGH STATUS: Working System Validated!**  
> Complete local testing successful. Phase 2 (friend testing) ready to begin.

## 🎯 What is StreamrP2P?

**StreamrP2P** is a revolutionary streaming platform where **friends earn rewards by supporting their favorite streamers** through bandwidth contribution. Instead of traditional donations or subscriptions, friends help distribute streams and earn money for their participation.

### 💡 Core Concept: "Restreaming as Support"
```
Your Stream → Friend's Node → Earns Rewards → Supports You
```

**How it works:**
1. **You stream** your content (gaming, creative, etc.)
2. **Friends run node clients** that help distribute your stream  
3. **Friends earn real money** based on uptime and performance
4. **Everyone wins**: You get better distribution, friends get paid

```

**Working Components:**
- **SRS RTMP Server**: Ingests live streams (port 1935)
- **FastAPI Coordinator**: Manages nodes, calculates earnings (port 8000)  
- **PostgreSQL + Redis**: Persistent data storage and session management
- **Worker Service**: Fraud detection and node validation
- **Node Clients**: Friend-run containers that connect and earn rewards

## 💰 Economics Model (Validated)

**How Friends Earn Money:**
1. **Uptime Rewards**: Earn based on how long your node stays connected
2. **Performance Bonuses**: Higher rewards for reliable, high-performing nodes  
3. **Fair Distribution**: Transparent algorithm splits stream's reward pool
4. **Fraud Protection**: Automated validation prevents cheating

**Current Implementation:**
- **Phase 2**: Manual payouts via Venmo/PayPal based on tracked earnings
- **Phase 3**: Automated blockchain payouts with token economics

**Real Test Data:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "payouts": {
    "test_stream_001": {
      "total_pool": 1000.0,
      "individual_earnings": 1000.0
    }
  }
}
```
