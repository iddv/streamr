---

## 🎯 **Current Phase: Phase 2C - Application Deployment - COMPLETE**

**Status**: ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**  
**Completion Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Key Achievement**: StreamrP2P application deployed and operational on AWS

### What Was Accomplished

1. **✅ Application Deployment**
   - StreamrP2P coordinator application deployed to AWS EC2
   - Database credentials properly configured with AWS Secrets Manager
   - Docker containers running coordinator and SRS streaming server
   - SSL-enabled PostgreSQL connection established

2. **✅ Network Configuration Resolution**
   - Identified and resolved ALB vs direct EC2 access issue
   - Security groups properly configured for production security
   - ALB routing HTTP traffic correctly to application on port 8000
   - Health checks passing and target group healthy

3. **✅ Service Validation**
   - API endpoints responding correctly via ALB
   - Health check: `{"status":"healthy","service":"coordinator"}`
   - Dashboard showing empty streams list (expected for new deployment)
   - Database and Redis connections operational

4. **✅ Cost Management Implementation**
   - Cost control script created with pause/resume functionality
   - Current cost analysis: ~$45/month (can reduce to ~$36/month)
   - EC2 stop/start capability to save ~$5.67/month when not testing
   - Detailed cost breakdown and optimization strategies documented

4. **HTTP Only**: No HTTPS/SSL termination at ALB (Phase 3 item)

## 💡 Next Major Milestone

**Phase 2D Completion Criteria**:
- 5+ friends successfully test streaming
- 10+ streams created and played back
- Performance validated under concurrent load
- Cost optimization strategies validated
- Zero critical bugs in production environment

**Target Completion**: End of June 2025
