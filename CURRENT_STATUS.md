## 🏗️ **Infrastructure Architecture**

### **Foundation Stack**
- **VPC**: Isolated network with public/private subnets
- **RDS PostgreSQL**: Managed database with automated backups
- **ElastiCache Redis**: Managed cache for high-performance coordination
- **Security Groups**: Least-privilege access controls

### **Application Stack**  
- **EC2 Instance**: Auto-configured with Docker, SRS, and application code
- **Application Load Balancer**: HTTPS termination and health checks
- **IAM Roles**: Minimal permissions for secrets and monitoring
- **CloudWatch**: Centralized logging and monitoring

### **Stage Configuration**
```
Beta:   t3.micro, no protection, basic monitoring   (~$27/month)
Gamma:  t3.small, deletion protection, detailed     (~$45/month) 
Prod:   t3.medium, multi-AZ, full protection       (~$120/month)
```

## 🎯 **NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS** 

### **Phase 2B: AWS Deployment** *(Ready to Start)*
1. **Deploy Beta Infrastructure**: `./infrastructure/scripts/deploy-beta.sh`
2. **Application Deployment**: Deploy StreamrP2P code to EC2 instance
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Validate RTMP + API + Dashboard on AWS
4. **Friend Network Testing**: Invite friends to test across real networks

### **Phase 2C: Production Readiness** *(Planned)*
1. **Domain & SSL**: Route53 + Certificate Manager setup
2. **Monitoring & Alerts**: CloudWatch dashboards and alarms  
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated deployments
4. **Multi-Region**: Expand to us-east-1 and ap-southeast-1
