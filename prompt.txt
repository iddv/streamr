Based on my web search, here are the key findings about Go RTMP libraries:

**Mature Go RTMP Libraries Available:**
1. **Monibuca** - A comprehensive Go streaming server framework with RTMP support, actively maintained by Chinese developers
2. **untangledco/streaming** - Contains packages for media streaming in Go, including RTP and other protocols  
3. **Harshitk-cp/rtmp_server** - A Go RTMP server that specifically handles RTMP to WebRTC transcoding using Pion WebRTC
4. **yutopop/rtmp** - Referenced in the Harshitk project, appears to be a Go RTMP library

**Key Insights:**
- There ARE production-ready Go RTMP implementations available
- The Harshitk project demonstrates exactly what we want: RTMP input â†’ WebRTC output using pure Go
- Pion WebRTC is the established Go WebRTC library (mentioned in awesome-go)
- The Node.js WHIP/WHEP implementation still uses external C++ binaries (rtmp_relay)

**Technical Decision Impact:**
This significantly changes the recommendation. Instead of embedding C++ rtmp_relay, we could potentially use pure Go RTMP libraries, making the binary truly self-contained with zero external dependencies.

Given this new information:
1. Should we revise the technical approach to use native Go RTMP instead of embedding C++ binaries?
2. How does this affect our Phase 0 MVP timeline and complexity?
3. What are the trade-offs between using established C++ tooling vs newer Go implementations?
4. Does this change the viability of the Rust approach as well?

Please provide your updated technical assessment based on these Go RTMP library findings.
