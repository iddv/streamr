# Debugging Narrative: The Phantom Deployment

## The Goal: Deploy the Stream Lifecycle System

Today, we aimed to deploy a major upgrade: the **Stream Lifecycle System**. This introduces a sophisticated state machine for managing streams (`READY`, `TESTING`, `LIVE`, etc.) and replaces the old, simplistic `"active"` status.

The new code, committed in `194af44`, was pushed to the `main` branch, triggering our automated GitHub Actions workflow to deploy to the `beta` stage in AWS.

## The Twist: A Successful Failure

The GitHub Actions workflow completed without errors. All green checkmarks. From the outside, it looked like a perfect deployment.

**But the application didn't change.**

We ran integration tests and manual `curl` commands against the production API endpoint (`http://streamr-p2p-beta-alb-1243469977.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com`), and the results were undeniable:

1.  **Old API Schema:** The `/streams` endpoint still returns the old data structure with `"status": "active"`. The new lifecycle states and timestamp fields are completely missing.
2.  **Missing Endpoints:** The new `/streams/live` endpoint, a core part of the lifecycle system, returns a `405 Method Not Allowed` error. It doesn't exist.

**Conclusion:** The infrastructure (Load Balancer, etc.) is running, but it's serving the **old version** of the coordinator application. The new code is nowhere to be found.

## Our Investigation: Peeling the Onion

We've done the external detective work:

1.  **Initial Hypothesis (Wrong):** At first, we suspected a database migration failure. We thought maybe the code was new, but the database schema was old because SQLAlchemy's `create_all()` doesn't alter existing tables. This was a red herring.
2.  **Correct Diagnosis:** We proved the API itself was old. The problem isn't just missing database columns; the API endpoints from the new code are physically not there.
3.  **Pinpointing the Failure:** The problem lies somewhere in the **container deployment process**. The GitHub Actions workflow succeeded, but the running ECS container was never actually updated with the new image.

## How Q Can Solve This Mystery

We've hit the limit of what we can diagnose from the outside. We need "eyes on the inside" of our AWS environment. This is where Q comes in. We need Q to investigate the internal state of our AWS resources to find the disconnect between the "successful" deployment and the running application.

### **Key Questions for Q:**

1.  **Check the Container Registry (ECR):** Did the GitHub Actions workflow successfully build and push the new Docker image (tagged with commit `194af44` or similar) to the ECR repository in `eu-west-1`? Does the image actually exist?
2.  **Inspect the ECS Service:** Look at the deployment history for the `streamr-p2p-beta-ireland-application` ECS service. Did it attempt to deploy a new version after commit `194af44` was pushed? What do the service events say?
3.  **Verify the Task Definition:** Is the latest ECS task definition pointing to the **new** container image tag, or is it still configured to use an old one? This is a common failure point.
4.  **Analyze the Deployment Logs:** Can Q retrieve the specific logs from the ECS service deployment itself? There might be a silent error hidden in there, like a permissions issue trying to pull the new image from ECR, which didn't bubble up to the GitHub Actions workflow.

By answering these questions, Q can bridge the gap between our code and the live environment, revealing exactly why our phantom deployment occurred.
