# StreamrP2P User Interface Requirements

**Document Purpose**: Comprehensive UI/UX requirements for StreamrP2P platform interfaces  
**Focus**: User experience and functionality (not technology implementation)  
**Created**: Based on consultation with Infrastructure Visionary, Economic Justice Architect, and Human Connection Catalyst advisors

## Executive Summary

StreamrP2P requires three primary user interfaces designed around the core principle: "Friends helping friends earn crypto rewards through P2P streaming." Each interface serves distinct user groups with different technical expertise levels and motivations.

**Key Design Principles**:
- **Technology should be invisible** - Complex P2P networking hidden behind simple, intuitive interfaces
- **Trust through transparency** - All economic models, calculations, and performance metrics clearly explained
- **Community over technology** - Human connections and relationships prioritized in design
- **Economic empowerment** - Users earn more than they spend, with clear paths to maximize earnings
- **Global accessibility** - Inclusive design serving diverse cultures, languages, and technical skill levels
