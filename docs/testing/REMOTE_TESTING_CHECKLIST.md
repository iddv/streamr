# 🔥 CRITICAL: Remote Testing Security Checklist

## ⚠️ **MANDATORY BEFORE ANY FRIENDS CONNECT**

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Security (Do This FIRST)

- [ ] **🏗️ SRS API Integration** (CRITICAL - #1 Priority)
  - [ ] Implement `GET /api/v1/clients/` polling service in FastAPI
  - [ ] Replace client self-reporting with server-authoritative data
  - [ ] Store `send_bytes` data as ground truth for bandwidth verification
  
- [ ] **💰 Reward Model Fix** (Prevents Sybil Attacks)
  - [ ] Replace uptime-based rewards with bandwidth-based: `node_reward = total_pool * (node_bytes_delivered / total_bytes_delivered)`
  - [ ] Remove equal-share model that rewards connection squatting
  
- [ ] **🛡️ Remove Vulnerable Fraud Detection**
  - [ ] Deprecate ffprobe spot checks (easily gameable)
  - [ ] Replace with continuous SRS API monitoring
  
- [ ] **🔐 Node Authentication**
  - [ ] Generate unique API keys for each friend
  - [ ] Implement JWT or API key authentication for all node endpoints
  - [ ] No open endpoints that accept anonymous reports

### Phase 2: Network Security 

- [ ] **🌐 Cloud Migration** (Highly Recommended)
  - [ ] Deploy to DigitalOcean/Vultr/Hetzner ($10/month)
  - [ ] Eliminates WSL2 networking complexity
  - [ ] Gets symmetric gigabit bandwidth vs home upload limits
  
- [ ] **🔥 Firewall & DDoS Protection**
  - [ ] Route through Cloudflare free tier
  - [ ] Rate limit API endpoints
  - [ ] Secure SRS configuration for public internet

### Phase 3: Friend Onboarding

- [ ] **📦 Simple Setup Script**
  - [ ] Create `run.sh` wrapper that takes API key as only argument
  - [ ] Auto-pulls latest Docker image
  - [ ] Clear error messages and progress indicators
  
- [ ] **👥 Technical Alpha Group**
  - [ ] Recruit 2-3 developer friends first
  - [ ] Set expectation: "You're testers, not users"
  - [ ] Focus on network/performance validation, not UX

## 🚨 **VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS**

**Current Critical Flaws:**
1. **Sybil Attack Vector**: 1 attacker can spawn 1000 fake nodes, earn 99% of rewards
2. **Trust Model**: System trusts client heartbeats without server verification  
3. **Binary Penalty**: One failed spot check = complete reward loss
4. **Connection Squatting**: Nodes earn full rewards for minimal bandwidth

**Impact**: These flaws will make your remote test economically irrational for honest friends.

## 📊 **SUCCESS METRICS FOR REMOTE TEST**

- [ ] **Security**: No fraudulent rewards paid to non-contributing nodes
- [ ] **Performance**: 3-5 concurrent friends, <2s API response times  
- [ ] **Economics**: Bandwidth-based rewards correlate with actual data delivery
- [ ] **Stability**: 30+ minute continuous operation across internet
- [ ] **Geography**: Friends connecting from different cities/networks

## 🔗 **Quick Start Commands**

Once security fixes are implemented:

```bash
# For friends (after you give them API key)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/streamr/main/setup-node.sh | bash -s YOUR_API_KEY

# Monitor your system
curl http://your-public-ip:8000/dashboard | jq
watch -n 10 'curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/clients | jq'
```

## ⚡ **Bottom Line**

**Don't skip the security fixes.** A single bad actor friend could exploit the current system and ruin your test results. The 1-day investment in proper security will save weeks of debugging and re-testing.
