## Epic 1: Coordinator Server âœ…

The central service responsible for orchestration, verification, and reward calculation.

-   **[Issue #1] Setup Basic Server & Database:** âœ…
    -   âœ… FastAPI project with PostgreSQL database
    -   âœ… SQLAlchemy models for streams, nodes, and probe results
    -   âœ… Docker configuration with docker-compose

-   **[Issue #2] Implement Core Endpoints:** âœ…
    -   âœ… `POST /streams`: Stream registration with token pools
    -   âœ… `GET /streams`: Stream discovery for node operators
    -   âœ… `POST /nodes/heartbeat`: Node heartbeat monitoring
    -   âœ… `GET /dashboard`: Real-time dashboard data

-   **[Issue #3] Implement Stats Collector Service:** âœ…
    -   âœ… Background worker polling `/stats.json` endpoints every 60s
    -   âœ… Validation of rtmp_relay stats data structure
    -   âœ… Database storage of probe results with success/failure tracking

-   **[Issue #4] Implement Spot-Check Prober Service:** âœ…
    -   âœ… Random interval RTMP connection testing using ffprobe
    -   âœ… Fraud detection for nodes reporting healthy but failing spot-checks
    -   âœ… Automatic flagging of fraudulent nodes

-   **[Issue #5] Implement Payout & Dashboard Logic:** âœ…
    -   âœ… Reward calculation based on uptime and fraud detection
    -   âœ… Analytics endpoints: `/payouts`, `/nodes/{id}/earnings`, `/leaderboard`
    -   âœ… Zero payout for flagged nodes, proportional rewards for honest nodes

---

## Epic 2: Node Client âœ…

The Dockerized package that operators will run. The goal is zero-friction setup.

-   **[Issue #6] Create Node Client Wrapper:** âœ…
    -   âœ… Python script managing rtmp_relay lifecycle
    -   âœ… Automatic stream discovery from coordinator
    -   âœ… Public IP discovery and heartbeat transmission
    -   âœ… Graceful shutdown and error handling

-   **[Issue #7] Dockerize the Node Client:** âœ…
    -   âœ… Dockerfile building rtmp_relay from source
    -   âœ… Environment variable configuration
    -   âœ… Docker-compose for easy testing
    -   âœ… Comprehensive README with zero-friction setup instructions

---

## Epic 3: Infrastructure & Documentation

The supporting elements needed to run the PoC.

-   **[Issue #8] Deploy Central Ingest Server:**
    -   Set up a cloud instance running `elnormous/rtmp_relay` in "host" mode to act as the single ingest point for the PoC.

-   **[Issue #9] Deploy Coordinator Server:**
    -   Deploy the Coordinator server application and its database to a cloud environment.

-   **[Issue #10] Create Tester Documentation:**
    -   Write a simple `README.md` for the PoC testers with clear, step-by-step instructions on how to run the Node Client Docker container.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

**ALL EPICS COMPLETE!** ðŸŽ‰ The PoC is ready for local testing:

1. **Local Testing Phase** - Use `start-host.sh` and invite friends with `setup-node.sh`
2. **Document Results** - Record performance, bugs, and feedback
3. **Cloud Deployment** - Move to production infrastructure after successful local testing
4. **Alpha Testing** - Scale to larger community group
5. **Iterate Based on Feedback** - Refine the system based on real-world usage

The core economic loop is now implemented and ready for testing:
- âœ… Stream registration with token pools
- âœ… Node discovery and participation  
- âœ… Continuous verification (stats + spot-checks)
- âœ… Fraud detection and prevention
- âœ… Reward calculation and distribution
