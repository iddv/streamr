# Final Report: Social Design & Governance

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides the final recommendations for the social dynamics and governance of the StreamrP2P "restreaming as support" model. The initial analysis highlighted the risks and opportunities of using a high-cost social signal. The final recommendation integrates the social design with the proposed technical architecture ("Hybrid PoBw") and legal strategy ("Progressive Decentralization"). The core principle is that **social status and governance power should be tied to verifiable, valuable contributions to the network's performance.**

## 2. Social Dynamics of the "Canary Network"

The "Canary Network" launch strategy provides a fertile ground for cultivating a healthy community culture.

- **Exclusivity and Status**: Participation in the Canary Network is opt-in and based on providing real value (sponsoring high-QoS streams or running high-performance nodes). This creates a social dynamic where being part of the Canary Network is a signal of commitment and status.
- **Culture of Quality**: Because the Canary Network is for premium, sponsored streams, the culture will be oriented around performance and reliability, not just passive participation. This directly counters the "engagement farming" risk.

## 3. Governance Model: Architecting for Progressive Decentralization

The legal strategy of progressive decentralization is also the core of the governance and social model. It provides a transparent path for shifting control from the core team to the community.

- **Phase 1 (Genesis - Managed Centralization)**: The core team controls protocol parameters via a multi-sig. This allows for rapid response to issues during the initial launch of the Canary Network. The social contract is clear: the team acts as a benevolent steward to ensure stability.
- **Phase 2 (Community Governance - DAO Control)**: After the network proves stable, control of the `Sponsorship` and reward parameter contracts is transferred to the Streamr DAO.
  - **Time-locks**: All proposed changes from the DAO are subject to a mandatory time-lock (e.g., 14 days). This is a critical social feature, as it prevents hostile takeovers and gives the community time to discuss, debate, and exit their positions if they disagree with a proposal.
- **Phase 3 (Ossification)**: The roadmap will publicly identify core protocol components that will eventually be made immutable. This builds long-term trust that the fundamental rules of the network cannot be arbitrarily changed.

## 4. Tying Social Status to Verifiable Contribution

The "Hybrid Proof-of-Bandwidth" system provides the foundation for a meritocratic social structure.

- **Reputation System**: A user's reputation score should be a direct function of their verifiable contributions:
  - **For Node Operators**: Uptime, successful delivery "lottery" wins, and a clean record with no slashing events.
  - **For Sponsors/Publishers**: The amount of DATA staked in `Sponsorship` contracts and the popularity of their streams.
- **Benefits of High Reputation**:
  - **Economic**: A higher reputation score could act as a multiplier on staking power, allowing trusted nodes to earn more yield with less capital.
  - **Governance**: In the DAO, voting power could be weighted not just by token count, but by a combination of tokens and reputation score (e.g., quadratic voting + reputation). This gives more influence to proven, long-term contributors over passive token holders.

This model makes social status something that is *earned* through actions that benefit the entire network, creating a powerful, positive feedback loop.
