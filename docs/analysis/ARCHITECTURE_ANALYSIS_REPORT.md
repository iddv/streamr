## 📊 Current System Status & Architecture

### **Operational Status**: Phase 2C Complete ✅
- **End-to-End Validation**: ✅ OBS → RTMP → SRS → HLS/FLV → VLC confirmed working
- **Live Content**: ✅ Gaming stream operational with 10MB+ segments at 10-second intervals
- **System Health**: ✅ All AWS services operational (RDS, ElastiCache, ALB, EC2)
- **API Coordination**: ✅ FastAPI handling dashboard requests and stream coordination

### **Architecture Stack Breakdown**

#### **Layer 1: Foundation Infrastructure (CDK)**
```
VPC 10.0.0.0/16 (eu-west-1)
├── Public Subnet: ALB + EC2
├── Private Subnet: RDS + ElastiCache  
├── Security Groups: Database, Cache, Instance, ALB
└── IAM Roles: Instance permissions for Secrets, CloudWatch, SSM
```

#### **Layer 2: Application Services (Docker)**
```
EC2 Instance (t3.micro: 3.254.102.92)
├── streamr-coordinator: FastAPI + Uvicorn (Port 8000)
│   ├── Stream management API
│   ├── P2P node coordination
│   ├── Payout/reward system
│   └── Dashboard interface
│
└── streamr-srs: SRS Streaming Server
    ├── RTMP Ingest (Port 1935)
    ├── HTTP API (Port 8080) 
    ├── HLS/FLV Output (Port 8085)
    └── Multi-protocol streaming
```

#### **Layer 3: Data & State Management**
```
PostgreSQL 15.13 (RDS)
├── streams: Stream metadata and status
├── payouts: Friend reward calculations
├── nodes: P2P node registration and health
└── users: Creator and supporter accounts

Redis 7 (ElastiCache)  
├── Session caching
├── Performance optimization
├── Real-time coordination
└── API response caching
```

#### **Layer 4: P2P Network (Phase 2D Ready)**
```
Friend Node Architecture (Ready to Deploy)
├── node-client/: Python P2P client implementation
├── Bandwidth contribution tracking
├── Reward calculation and distribution
├── Real-time coordination with central hub
└── One-click setup for friend supporters
```

### **Critical Technical Achievement** 🔧

**Issue**: SRS server listening on internal port 8080, but Docker mapping configured as `8085:8085`  
**Solution**: Fixed mapping to `8085:8080` in `infrastructure/scripts/deploy-application.sh`  
**Result**: ✅ VLC compatibility achieved via HTTP-FLV protocol  

This fix was the breakthrough that enabled end-to-end streaming validation.

## 🌐 Data Flow Architecture

### **Current Operational Flow** (Phase 2C)
```
Content Creator (OBS) 
    ↓ RTMP Stream (rtmp://ip:1935/live)
SRS Streaming Server 
    ├─ HLS Output (.m3u8) → Web Browsers
    └─ HTTP-FLV Output (.flv) → VLC Players
    
Viewers ←→ ALB ←→ StreamrP2P Coordinator ←→ PostgreSQL + Redis
```

### **Future P2P Flow** (Phase 2D+)
```
Content Creator (OBS)
    ↓ RTMP Stream  
Central AWS Hub (SRS + Coordinator)
    ├─ Direct Streaming → Primary Viewers
    └─ P2P Distribution ↓
        Friend Node 1 ←→ Coordinator (Rewards)
        Friend Node 2 ←→ Coordinator (Rewards)  
        Friend Node 3 ←→ Coordinator (Rewards)
            ↓ Bandwidth Sharing
        Secondary Viewers (VLC, Web, Mobile)
```
