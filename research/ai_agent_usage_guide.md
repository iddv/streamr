# AI Agent Roleplay Consultation System Usage Guide

## Overview

The StreamrP2P project includes an AI agent roleplay system designed to provide specialized consultation from three domain expert perspectives. This system allows you to present product decisions, documents, or strategic questions to AI agents that embody the decision-making frameworks and expertise of critical platform roles.

## "Consult with Our Zen Advisors" Workflow

**This is a peer review process, not delegation.** When you request to **"consult with our zen advisors"**, the AI agent will:

1. **Do Initial Work**: Research, analyze, and develop initial solution/design based on your request
2. **Present to Zen Advisors**: Use zen tools to present the initial work to each advisor role for expert review:
   - üîß **Infrastructure Visionary** - Technical architecture review
   - üí∞ **Economic Justice Architect** - Economic impact analysis  
   - üåç **Human Connection Catalyst** - Community adoption assessment
3. **Gather Expert Insights**: Collect advisor feedback, concerns, and improvement suggestions
4. **Synthesize Improved Solution**: Integrate advisor insights to refine and improve the initial work

### Example Request Flow:
```
You: "I want to consult with our zen advisors about implementing mobile notifications."

AI Agent: 
‚Üí Researches mobile notification best practices and designs initial implementation plan
‚Üí Presents plan to Infrastructure Visionary for technical review and optimization suggestions
‚Üí Presents plan to Economic Justice Architect for user earning impact analysis
‚Üí Presents plan to Human Connection Catalyst for community engagement assessment
‚Üí Synthesizes all feedback into refined implementation strategy
```

**Key Principle**: Zen advisors provide expert scrutiny and insights to improve your work, not replace your thinking. You lead the design process; they provide quality assurance and enhancement.

## How to Use the AI Agent System

### Option 1: Quick Multi-Perspective Consultation
**Recommended for most decisions**

Simply say: **"Consult with our zen advisors about [your question/decision]"**

The AI agent will automatically:
- Research and develop an initial solution/approach
- Present the work to all three zen advisors for expert review
- Gather their feedback, concerns, and improvement suggestions
- Deliver a refined solution incorporating their insights

### Option 2: Individual Agent Consultation

#### 1. Select the Appropriate Agent(s)
Choose the agent(s) whose expertise aligns with your question or decision:
- **Technical questions**: Decentralized Infrastructure Visionary
- **Economics/tokenomics questions**: Economic Justice Architect  
- **Community/partnerships questions**: Human Connection Catalyst
- **Complex decisions**: Multiple agents for different perspectives

#### 2. Frame Your Question or Scenario
Provide context about:
- The specific decision or challenge you're facing
- Any relevant background information about the platform
- What kind of advice or analysis you're seeking

#### 3. Request the Agent Perspective
Ask for the AI agent to roleplay as the specific persona:

```
"Please roleplay as the Decentralized Infrastructure Visionary from StreamrP2P and provide your perspective on..."
```

#### 4. Review the Agent Response
The AI agent will respond with:
- Analysis from that role's perspective and expertise
- Decision-making framework application
- Specific recommendations aligned with the role's priorities
- Potential concerns or considerations from that domain

## Example Consultation Scenarios

### Technical Architecture Decision
**Question**: "Should we use WebRTC or custom UDP protocols for mobile P2P streaming?"

**Agent**: Decentralized Infrastructure Visionary  
**Expected Response**: Performance analysis, battery optimization considerations, scalability implications, development complexity trade-offs

### Tokenomics Design Question
**Question**: "How should we structure viewer rewards to ensure sustainable earning without creating exploitation?"

**Agent**: Economic Justice Architect  
**Expected Response**: Anti-exploitation analysis, sustainable earning models, wealth distribution considerations, transparency requirements

### Community Strategy Question
**Question**: "How should we approach international expansion while respecting local communities?"

**Agent**: Human Connection Catalyst  
**Expected Response**: Cultural adaptation strategies, community-led expansion approaches, partnership frameworks, local empowerment considerations

## Multi-Agent Consultation

For complex decisions affecting multiple domains, consult multiple agents:

1. **Present the same scenario to each relevant agent**
2. **Compare their different perspectives and priorities**
3. **Look for alignment and identify potential conflicts**
4. **Synthesize insights for balanced decision-making**

### Example Multi-Agent Scenario
**Question**: "Should we implement a micro-payment system for premium content?"

- **Decentralized Infrastructure Visionary**: Technical implementation complexity, scalability concerns
- **Economic Justice Architect**: Creator revenue impact, user earning optimization, economic justice implications
- **Human Connection Catalyst**: Community response, accessibility concerns, cultural adaptation needs

## Best Practices

### Effective Questions
- Be specific about the decision context
- Include relevant constraints or requirements
- Ask for both benefits and risks/concerns
- Request specific recommendations, not just analysis

### Ineffective Questions
- Vague or overly broad questions
- Questions outside the agent's expertise domain
- Asking for information rather than perspective/advice
- Questions requiring real-time data or current market information

### Maximizing Value
- **Prepare context**: Gather relevant information before consultation
- **Ask follow-up questions**: Dig deeper into the agent's reasoning
- **Challenge assumptions**: Ask agents to defend their recommendations
- **Cross-reference**: Compare different agents' perspectives on related topics

## Agent Personas in Decision-Making

### Tri-Lock Power Structure
Each agent represents a domain with specific decision authority:
- **Technical decisions**: Infrastructure Visionary has final say
- **Economic decisions**: Economic Justice Architect has final say
- **Community decisions**: Human Connection Catalyst has final say

### Collaborative Decision Framework
For decisions affecting multiple domains:
1. **Each agent provides domain expertise**
2. **Identify potential conflicts between domains**
3. **Negotiate solutions that satisfy all domain requirements**
4. **Ensure alignment with overall platform principles**

## Platform-Specific Context

All agents understand StreamrP2P's core principles:
- **90% creator revenue share** (vs 50% industry standard)
- **Watch-to-earn viewer economics** ($50-200 monthly potential)
- **Gaming hardware monetization** (idle GPU/CPU utilization)
- **Sub-5-second mobile latency** target
- **80% infrastructure cost reduction** through P2P
