# Job Specification: Decentralized Infrastructure Visionary
**Role Type:** Co-Founder / Chief Technology Officer  
**Location:** Remote-first with quarterly in-person strategy sessions  
**Compensation:** Equity-heavy with performance milestones  
**Start Date:** Immediate (Phase 1 research support)

## Position Overview
Lead the technical architecture and implementation of StreamrP2P's mobile-first P2P streaming platform, ensuring every technical decision creates earning opportunities for users while maintaining privacy and open communication principles.

## SMART Requirements

### Technical Expertise Requirements
- **Demonstrate 5+ years hands-on experience** with WebRTC implementation in production environments serving 100,000+ concurrent users
- **Provide portfolio evidence** of mobile battery optimization achieving <3% drain during media processing on devices with 2GB+ RAM
- **Show documented experience** reducing P2P latency to sub-3-second performance on mobile networks (4G/5G) in at least 2 previous projects
- **Present technical architecture designs** for mesh networking systems handling 10,000+ simultaneous peer connections with automatic fallback mechanisms

### Platform Philosophy Alignment
- **Complete technical assessment** demonstrating how proposed solutions work on devices as old as iPhone 8/Android API 26 within 30 days of hire
- **Deliver architecture proposal** showing how idle device resources can generate $50-200 monthly income for device owners within 60 days
- **Design privacy-first system architecture** where user data never touches centralized servers, verified through security audit within 90 days

### Vision Execution Metrics
- **Achieve <5-second streaming latency** on mobile devices in controlled testing environment within 120 days of project start
- **Maintain <2% battery consumption** during 1-hour streaming sessions across 5 different mobile device models within 180 days
- **Demonstrate P2P network efficiency** of 70%+ peer delivery ratio (vs CDN fallback) in beta testing with 1,000+ users by month 8

### Innovation Leadership
- **Publish 2+ technical blog posts** monthly explaining complex P2P concepts in accessible language for mainstream adoption
- **File 1 provisional patent application** quarterly for novel mobile P2P optimizations developed for StreamrP2P
- **Deliver 4+ conference presentations** annually at technical conferences (WebRTC Live, P2P Summit, Mobile Dev Summit)

### Team Development
- **Recruit and manage 3+ senior engineers** specializing in mobile optimization, P2P networking, and embedded systems within 6 months
- **Conduct bi-weekly technical reviews** with 90%+ on-time delivery of sprint commitments across engineering team
- **Maintain 85%+ team satisfaction score** through quarterly anonymous feedback surveys

### Business Impact Metrics
- **Reduce infrastructure costs by 80%** compared to traditional CDN-based streaming within 12 months of MVP launch
- **Enable user earning opportunities** averaging $100+ monthly for active participants within 18 months
- **Achieve technical scalability** supporting 100,000+ concurrent users with <$50,000 monthly infrastructure costs by end of year 2

### Open Source Contribution
- **Release 2+ open source libraries** annually that benefit the broader P2P streaming ecosystem
- **Contribute 50+ commits monthly** to relevant open source projects (WebRTC, libp2p, mobile optimization tools)
- **Maintain 4.5+ star rating** on team's open source repositories with active community engagement

## Required Experience Validation
**Candidates must provide:**
- **Live demo** of mobile P2P application they've built serving real users
- **Performance benchmarks** from previous projects showing latency and battery consumption metrics
- **3 technical references** from previous roles who can validate mobile optimization expertise
- **Portfolio of contributions** to open source P2P or mobile streaming projects

## Success Criteria (First 12 Months)
- **Technical MVP delivery** achieving all core performance metrics (latency, battery, P2P efficiency)
- **Team building success** with fully staffed engineering organization meeting sprint commitments
- **Community recognition** as thought leader in mobile P2P streaming space
- **Patent portfolio** of 4+ applications protecting novel StreamrP2P innovations
- **User value creation** with demonstrable earning opportunities for beta participants

## Red Flags (Automatic Disqualification)
- **No demonstrable mobile optimization experience** with battery consumption metrics
- **History of building surveillance-based** or user-data-exploitative systems
- **Cannot explain technical approach** to achieving <5-second mobile P2P latency in interview
- **Unwilling to commit equity compensation** over traditional high-salary arrangements
- **No evidence of community engagement** or open source contributions in past 2 years

## Interview Process
1. **Technical Architecture Review** (2 hours): Present solution for mobile P2P streaming challenges
2. **Live Coding Session** (3 hours): Optimize WebRTC implementation for mobile battery efficiency  
3. **Vision Alignment Discussion** (1 hour): Discuss approach to creating user earning opportunities through technical design
4. **Team Collaboration Exercise** (2 hours): Work with existing team on real StreamrP2P technical challenge
5. **Reference Validation** (1 week): Deep dive with previous colleagues and technical references
