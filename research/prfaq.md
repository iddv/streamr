## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Product & Technology

**Q: How does P2P streaming work on mobile devices without draining battery?**

A: Our proprietary mobile optimization technology only activates P2P features when devices are on Wi-Fi with >30% battery. We leverage mobile GPU/DSP capabilities for hardware-accelerated transcoding and use intelligent battery monitoring to participate only when optimal conditions exist. Independent testing shows less than 2% additional battery consumption during typical usage.

**Q: What happens if there aren't enough peers available for P2P streaming?**

A: StreamrP2P uses a hybrid architecture that seamlessly falls back to traditional CDN delivery when P2P isn't optimal. Our AI coordination layer automatically balances between P2P, edge caching, and CDN based on real-time network conditions, ensuring uninterrupted streaming regardless of peer availability.

**Q: How do you achieve sub-5-second latency when blockchain transactions take longer?**

A: Streaming happens entirely off-chain using WebRTC P2P connections. Blockchain is only used for rewards settlement, content licensing, and reputation management - none of which affect real-time streaming performance. Critical streaming operations bypass blockchain entirely.

**Q: What's the quality difference compared to traditional streaming platforms?**

A: StreamrP2P supports up to 4K quality with adaptive bitrate streaming. Our distributed transcoding using idle gaming hardware often provides superior quality-to-bandwidth ratio compared to centralized platforms. Quality automatically adapts based on each viewer's connection and device capabilities.

### Economics & Monetization

**Q: How sustainable is the 90% creator revenue share?**

A: Our P2P architecture eliminates 80-90% of traditional infrastructure costs. Combined with blockchain-based micro-transactions, we can maintain sustainable economics while offering creators industry-leading revenue shares. Revenue is diversified across creator subscriptions, viewer token purchases, and infrastructure participation rewards.

**Q: How much can viewers realistically earn through watch-to-earn?**

A: Beta testing shows active viewers earning $50-200/month depending on engagement levels and network contribution. Earnings come from watching content (token rewards), contributing bandwidth during streaming, and participating in community governance. Heavy users who also contribute gaming hardware for transcoding can earn significantly more.

**Q: What prevents token inflation from devaluing rewards?**

A: Our tokenomics include multiple deflationary mechanisms: token burning through premium features, staking requirements for network participation, and utility-based demand through platform services. Token supply is capped with predictable release schedules tied to network growth metrics.

**Q: How does the gaming integration monetization work?**

A: Gamers earn tokens by contributing idle GPU/CPU power for video transcoding when not gaming. Smart contracts automatically detect idle periods and queue transcoding jobs, with payments based on hardware performance and job completion quality. Gaming sessions always take priority over transcoding tasks.

### User Experience & Adoption

**Q: Do viewers need crypto wallets to use the platform?**

A: No. StreamrP2P offers both crypto-native (wallet-based) and traditional user experiences. Non-crypto users can earn and spend rewards through integrated fiat systems, with optional migration to full blockchain control as they become more comfortable with the technology.

**Q: How do you prevent low-quality or harmful content?**

A: We implement multi-layer content moderation including AI-based pre-screening, community reporting, and human review for flagged content. Blockchain-based creator reputation systems and stake-based participation create economic incentives for quality content. Content violations result in both platform penalties and token slashing.

**Q: What's the onboarding process for new creators?**

A: Creators can start streaming immediately with just an account signup. Advanced features like custom token economies and gaming hardware integration can be enabled progressively. We provide migration tools for importing audiences from existing platforms and white-glove onboarding for high-profile creators.

**Q: How does this work internationally and with different regulations?**

A: StreamrP2P operates as a decentralized protocol with regional compliance layers. Content policies adapt to local regulations, payment processing integrates with regional financial systems, and data handling complies with local privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). Users access the network through regional gateways that ensure regulatory compliance.

### Technical Implementation

**Q: What blockchain networks do you use?**

A: We primarily use Arbitrum for cost-effective Layer 2 operations, with Ethereum mainnet for critical security functions. The architecture supports multi-chain deployment, allowing users to choose their preferred blockchain ecosystem. Cross-chain bridges enable seamless token transfers between supported networks.

**Q: How do you handle content discovery without centralized algorithms?**

A: StreamrP2P uses a hybrid approach combining decentralized content indexing with user-controlled algorithm preferences. Viewers can choose from community-built recommendation engines, creator-curated lists, or traditional algorithmic discovery. Social features enable community-driven content promotion without platform manipulation.

**Q: What's your data privacy and security model?**

A: All personal data remains encrypted and user-controlled. P2P streaming happens through end-to-end encrypted connections. Blockchain interactions are pseudonymous, and users can opt for additional privacy layers through zero-knowledge proofs. We never store unencrypted personal data on centralized servers.

**Q: How do you prevent spam and Sybil attacks in the token economy?**

A: Multiple anti-spam mechanisms include proof-of-stake requirements for network participation, reputation-based reward multipliers, and hardware fingerprinting for unique device identification. Machine learning models detect and prevent coordinated manipulation attempts. Economic penalties make attacks expensive relative to honest participation.
