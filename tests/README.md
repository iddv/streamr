# StreamrP2P Integration Tests

## 🎯 **Philosophy: Simple, Incremental, Focused**

This testing framework starts **simple and practical**, focusing on validating your **Stream Lifecycle System** that you just successfully deployed to production.

## 📁 **Test Structure**

```
tests/
├── conftest.py                        # Test fixtures and configuration
├── test_stream_lifecycle_integration.py  # Core lifecycle state machine tests  
├── test_production_smoke.py           # Production health and performance tests
└── README.md                          # This file
```

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **1. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

### **2. Run Tests (Parameterized)**
```bash
# Test against local coordinator with smoke tests (default)
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh local smoke

# Test against production with all tests
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh production all

# Test against custom URL with lifecycle tests
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh http://my-coordinator.com lifecycle

# GitHub Actions style (direct URL)
export TEST_TARGET="http://deployed-coordinator.com"
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh "$TEST_TARGET" smoke
```

**Available Targets**: `local`, `production`, `beta`, or any `http://...` URL  
**Available Suites**: `smoke` (safe for production), `lifecycle`, `all`

### **3. GitHub Actions Integration**
Integration tests run automatically after each deployment to production, validating:
- ✅ Stream lifecycle state machine works correctly
- ✅ New `/streams/live` endpoint functions properly
- ✅ API performance is acceptable
- ✅ Database schema includes new lifecycle fields

## 🔬 **Test Categories**

### **Integration Tests** (`test_stream_lifecycle_integration.py`)
**Purpose**: Validate Stream Lifecycle System end-to-end
- ✅ Complete state machine: READY → TESTING → LIVE → OFFLINE → STALE → ARCHIVED
- ✅ Invalid transition rejection
- ✅ Status filtering on `/streams` endpoint
- ✅ Timestamp tracking for lifecycle events

### **Production Smoke Tests** (`test_production_smoke.py`)
**Purpose**: Verify production deployment health (read-only, safe)
- ✅ Health check endpoints respond
- ✅ API schema validation (new lifecycle fields exist)
- ✅ Performance testing (< 2 second response times)
- ✅ `/streams/live` endpoint filtering works correctly

## 🛠 **Environment Configuration**

Tests use **parameterized configuration** for maximum flexibility:

```bash
# Method 1: Use predefined targets
export TEST_TARGET="local"        # http://localhost:8000
export TEST_TARGET="production"   # Production coordinator
export TEST_TARGET="beta"         # Beta coordinator

# Method 2: Direct URL override (GitHub Actions style)
export TEST_TARGET="http://my-deployed-coordinator.com"

# Legacy method (still supported)
export COORDINATOR_URL="http://custom-coordinator.com"
```

**The tests automatically detect and display which coordinator they're testing against.**

## ✅ **Benefits of This Approach**

### **1. Immediate Value**
- Tests your **actual working production system**
- Validates the Stream Lifecycle System you just built
- Catches deployment issues quickly

### **2. No Infrastructure Overhead**
- No Docker containers to manage (initially)
- No complex database setup required
- Fast execution (< 30 seconds for full suite)

### **3. Production-Safe**
- Read-only smoke tests safe for production
- Write tests create unique test streams and clean up after themselves
- No interference with real users or streams

### **4. Incremental Evolution**
- Start simple, add complexity as needed
- Easy to add testcontainers later if desired
- Foundation for more comprehensive testing

## 🔄 **Future Evolution Path**

As your system grows, you can incrementally add:

1. **Testcontainers** (when test isolation becomes critical)
2. **Contract Testing** (for Node.js client integration)
3. **Performance Testing** (with tools like locust)
4. **Chaos Testing** (for resilience validation)

## 🎯 **Current Status**

✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Stream Lifecycle System with integration tests
🚀 **Next**: Continue with Phase 2 (Broadcast/IngestProfile separation) 
📊 **Future**: Analytics pipeline and smart supporter allocation

## 🧪 **Running Specific Tests**

```bash
# Just lifecycle state machine tests
pytest tests/test_stream_lifecycle_integration.py::test_stream_lifecycle_state_machine -v

# Just production health checks
pytest tests/test_production_smoke.py::test_production_health_check -v

# All tests with detailed output
pytest tests/ -v -s
```
