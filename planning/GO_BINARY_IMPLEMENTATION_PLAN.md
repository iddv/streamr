## 🚨 **Risk Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Go RTMP Performance**: Early performance testing vs Python
- **libp2p Complexity**: Start with simple relay, add hole punching iteratively
- **Binary Size**: Profile and optimize if needed

### **User Adoption Risks**  
- **Security Warnings**: Code signing certificates required
- **Network Issues**: Comprehensive fallback strategies
- **Platform Support**: Test on real user devices early

### **Integration Risks**
- **Coordinator Changes**: Maintain API compatibility 
- **Existing Users**: Keep Python client working in parallel
- **Migration**: Gradual rollout strategy
